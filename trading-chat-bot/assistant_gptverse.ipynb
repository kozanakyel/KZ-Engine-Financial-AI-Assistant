The application developed as a result includes a backend data and AI modelling pipeline as well as a frontend for users to view the coin signal results and how many tweets were evaluated. However, investors should exercise caution and consider all relevant information before making investment decisions as predicting the movement of cryptocurrencies can be challenging due to their volatility.

Then, you can use machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, or neural networks to train a model on the historical data. This model can then be used to make predictions on new data and generate trading signals based on those predictions. However, it's important to note that predicting financial markets is inherently uncertain, and it's always advisable to exercise caution and consider multiple sources of information before making investment decisions.
