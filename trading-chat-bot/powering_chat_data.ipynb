It will be a multi-chain project but the main network has not  been decided yet. Here is a list of the main solutions, as follows in the first place:    -Innovative Product Proposal (AI Based 3D Objects)    Quickly transfer photos of real world objects that are taken from different angles to the 3D  Metaverse environment by passing them through special AI and machine learning algorithms  such as NERF. Users and brands can list and sell them on user stores as NFTs.    -AI Based Event &amp; Educational Areas    Bots with machine learning that can educate users on various topics. There is also a bot that  will organize events like concerts, exhibitions and help users have fun while having a good  time.    -OpenAI Integrated &amp; Conversational AI Assistant Bots    AI bots assist the user when they enter the GptVerse to find the place the user is looking for.  They also assist customers as store assistants with Conversational AI features. Other  features of bot: Event hall organization planner, the bot that finds the song when you hum.    -Metaverse Store Solutions    Besides most known NFT stores, automated and innovative NFT stores which users &amp;  brands can design using our builder editor. Objects and structures that users can create  verbally or in writing in GptVerse.    -Common metaverse usage (conference hall, concert venue, playground)    Areas where users can spend valuable time by making use of known metaverse features.    -Play to Earn Games &amp; Tournaments    Every user can play games and earn tokens. Bowling, billiards, chess and many more table  games will be integrated.    —----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    GptVerse is a unique and innovative application that combines AI-based technology and  Metaverse features to create a variety of solutions for users and brands.</td>\n",

This research also involved studying other technical analysis and indicator structures, as well as incorporating Twitter data and sentiment analysis scores. The research resulted in the development of an application with a backend data and AI modelling pipeline, as well as a frontend for users to view the coin signal results and relevant Twitter data. While the project will provide useful insights, investors should exercise caution before making investment decisions due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the many external factors that may affect them.\n"
