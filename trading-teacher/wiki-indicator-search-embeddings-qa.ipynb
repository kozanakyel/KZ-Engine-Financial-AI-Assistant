However, in March 2013, the blockchain temporarily split into two independent chains with different rules due to a bug in version 0.8 of the bitcoin software, causing the price to drop by 23%. In 2014, prices started at $770 and fell to $314 for the year. In 2015, prices started at $314 and rose to $434 for the year. In 2016, prices rose and climbed up to $998 by 1 January 2017. The price on 1 January 2018 was $13,412.44, but then fell sharply due to China banning trading in bitcoin, reaching $6,914 on 5 February 2018. The price on 1 January 2019 was $3,747, down 72% for 2018 and down 81% since the all-time high. In 2020, bitcoin fell below $4,000 during a broad market selloff, after trading above $10,000 in February 2020. However, in November 2020, the bitcoin value reached a new all-time high of $19,860. In May 2022, the bitcoin price fell to $31,324, as a result of a collapse of a UST stablecoin experiment named Terra, with bitcoin down more than 50% since the November 2021 high.\""
